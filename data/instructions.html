<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Instructions</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.1 Entering Numbers</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Click on a cell, then press a number 
  key on the keyboard. Hit delete, backspace, or space to clear a cell. You can 
  also clear a cell by pressing the number that it currently contains.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.2 Entering Markups</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To enter a markup, right click a 
  cell and enter digits from 1 to 9. Pressing a digit once will enter amarkup. 
  Pressing the same digit again will clear it. To clear all markups, hit delete 
  or backspace. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For information on the uses of markups, 
  see Wikipedia.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 2.3 The Lock Checkbox</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Locked cells are highlighted in blue. 
  You cannot enter text in a locked cell. Unchecking <strong>lock</strong> will 
  unlock all cells. Checking <strong>lock</strong> will lock down all filled cells, 
  and check the puzzle for difficulty and solvability. You can use this feature 
  to create your own puzzles or enter a puzzle from another source.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.4 The Conflicts Checkbox</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If <strong>conflicts</strong> is 
  checked, the program will highlight conflicts in red as you enter them. Note 
  that just because a cell is not highlighted does not mean it is correct, only 
  that there is no obvious conflict right now.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.5 The New Button</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creates a new puzzle. You will be 
  asked to choose a difficulty, and then a new Sudoku puzzle of that difficulty 
  will be created for you.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.6 Puzzle Difficulty</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Very Easy, Easy and Moderate:</strong> 
    These puzzles can be solved with a scanning strategy (see Wikipedia).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Hard and Very Hard:</strong> 
    These puzzles will require a markup/analysis strategy (see Wikipedia) at some 
    point.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Extremely Hard:</strong> 
    These puzzles will require a trial and error strategy at some point. Schmudoku 
    will not generate Extremely Hard puzzles for you, but it can recognize an 
    Extremely Hard puzzle if you enter one and lock it in.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.7 The Solve Button</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automatically solves the puzzle based 
  on the locked cells. Cells that the computer fills in during this process will 
  be highlighted in yellow, and cells that you had filled incorrectly will be 
  highlighted in red.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.8 The Clear Button</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clears unlocked cells and/or annotations. 
  You will be asked to choose whether you want to clear all the main entries, 
  the markups, just the conflicts, or everything.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.9 The Undo and Redo Buttons</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> 
  buttons are for undoing and redoing operations. These buttons are enabled only 
  when undo and/or redo are available. The undo buffer contains 100 entries.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. How Schumdoku! Works</font></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.1 Solving and Rating Puzzles</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schmudoku! rates a puzzle by attempting 
  to solve it. The first attempt uses only scanning (see Wikipedia) -- Schmudoku! 
  scans rows, columns and 3x3 boxes looking for a digit that can only go in one 
  spot. If the puzzle can be solved this way, then it is rated as either Very 
  Easy, Easy, or Moderate. The particular rating depends mostly on the average 
  number of cells that were filled in on each complete pass (where a pass is a 
  complete scan of every row, column, and box), but it also takes into account 
  the number of bottlenecks encountered. A bottleneck is any complete scan that 
  results in only one new cell being filled in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the puzzle cannot be solved by 
  scanning, another attempt is made using both scanning and markup strategies. 
  Hard puzzles are those that can be solved by a combination of scanning and a 
  markup strategy that looks for cells that can only be filled in by a single 
  digit. Very Hard puzzles also involve the use of a markup strategy that engages 
  in candidate elimination by identifying matched cell groups (see Wikipedia). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the puzzle cannot be solved by 
  scanning or marking up, Schmudoku! resorts to a backtracking algorithm. The 
  backtracking algorithm tries all possible combinations of digits in the remaining 
  cells looking for one combination that works. If the puzzle can only be solved 
  this way, then it is classified as Extremely Hard. If not, then it is unsolveable. 
  Backtracking can alsoidentify whether the puzzle has more than one solution.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.2 Creating Puzzles</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schmudoku! creates puzzles by first 
  finding a valid solved puzzle (there are very few of these relative to the total 
  number of 9x9 arrangements of digits), and then blanking out cells a few at 
  a time and attempting to solve the resulting puzzles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schmudoku! finds valid solved puzzles 
  using a technique called Random Mutation Hill Climbing. It starts by arranging 
  the digits 1 to 9 randomly in each 3x3 box. Then it produces a score for the 
  puzzle by counting the number of conflicts in each row and column (the number 
  of repeated digits). A score of 0 is a valid solved puzzle, anything higher 
  must be changed. At each step of the hill climbing, Schmudoku! randomly chooses 
  one of the 3x3 boxes and then randomly swaps two of the digits within that box. 
  Then it scores the board again. If the board gets a better (lower) score, it 
  is kept. If it doesn't, it gets thrown away. The process continues until a valid 
  solved puzzle is found. (It's like trying to climb a hill by taking one step 
  at a time in a random direction, and then figuring out whether you are higher 
  or lower than you were before.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next step is to create a partially 
  filled in puzzle. Schmudoku! does this by randomly blanking out a few cells 
  at a time and attempting to solve the puzzle. If the puzzle cannot be solved 
  using scanning and markup strategies, the blanked out cells are filled back 
  in and the process repeats. After Schmudoku! can make no more progress in this 
  way, it is finished and the puzzle can be rated. You may have noticed that Schmudoku! 
  produces symmetrical boards. This is because it always blanks out 2 or 4 cells 
  at a time, and does it in such a way as to keep the symmetry of the board.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not all puzzles created in this way 
  are acceptable. If the puzzle has more than 30 clues, or does not fit any of 
  the rating criteria (i.e., it doesn't fit the definition of Very Easy, Easy, 
  Moderate, Hard, or Very Hard), then it is discarded and the whole process continues 
  until a puzzle is found that fits the criteria. That's why it can sometimes 
  take a few seconds to find a new puzzle.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.2 Inefficiencies</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are lots of inefficiencies 
  in the board creation process described above, and it's an ongoing project to 
  produce a more efficient board creator. The first main focus will be on the 
  process that goes from a solved puzzle to a blanked-out one. This algorithm 
  should really check the difficulty level as it goes and throw away puzzles that 
  don't fit the current level of difficulty. But this is harder than it sounds 
  because the difficulty ratings don't make much sense until most of the cells 
  are blank. (To see this, try solving a board using Schmudoku, then blank out 
  one cell, and unlokc and lock to generate a rating). But if this step can be 
  improved, then fewer puzzles will be produced that don't fit the criteria, and 
  the puzzle creation process will be considerably faster.</font></p>
